### 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi I am TJ. I am a 16 year old German living in Ireland I started programming in 2019 while the corona Pandemic on that time I was 11 and got my first laptop for Christmas it was like a Dream I started Programming with Python. Soon I found the Social app Discord and Started to make friends under a different name than my name now BlackDev. after 1 year I discovered Java and started to program with that doing things for Minecraft like Plugins or mods after 1.5-2 years I wanted to have a portfolio website so I learned HTML CSS and a little bit of JS. 

PS: I don't like Kotlin (I still learn it)
